# The Odin Project Landing Page

A landing page created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

Note: Best viewed at 1366 x 768 px. This is not responsive and will most likely break at other screen sizes and resolutions.

## Reflection

This was the first project that I was genuinely excited about, mainly because it was something that I've never done before, and also because I wanted to know how to be able to turn designs into code, which I think I did successfully.

Although it might not be technically accurate (in terms of how I've used flexbox), the main focus here was on the design, where my aim was to develop a site that was as visually similar to the example as possible, even though I've added some little things of my own.

Overall, it was an interesting (yet frustrating) exercise, and the things that I found the hardest were the sections that combined text and image, specifically with the "information" section, as well as using flexbox correctly.

However, with that said, it was an interesting learning experience since I know that I've learned a lot more by doing things through trial and error (as well as referring to the docs, doing research, and asking for help when it was needed) instead of just merely reading the docs, watching videos of someone else coding, and previously taking courses (before I discovered TOP) that hold your hand way too much as well as giving you the illusion that you're making progress even though you're still at square one.

Once I completed the "information" section, designing the rest of the page was significantly easier, mainly because I'd be dealing with just text, and also because I started to understand what each flexbox property did.

The CSS code might not be fully clean (and there might be a few unnecessary things in there), but this has been the most advanced thing I've actually done with HTML and CSS so far, so in a way, I'm glad to know that I can not only design a landing page, but that I can also develop it as closely to the design as possible, and to me, that is a really big win.
